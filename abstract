Myshkin:  A Computer Program for Evaluating 
          the At-Issue Entailments of English Sentences

                --- Statement of Project Purpose ---

      The purpose of this project was to implement a
computer program based on linguistic theories of syntax and
semantics.  The program translates English sentences into
logical formulas which are evaluated with respect to a model
to determine if they are true, false, or undeterminable
statements.

      The program works in three parts: a parser, a
translator, and an evaluator.  The parser component
determines the structure of each input sentence based on
formal rules of grammar and a dictionary.  The translator
takes these structures from the parser and with translation
rules creates statements of mathematical logic.  The
evaluator component then evaluates the logical statements
with respect to the model to determine if the statement is
true, false, or unknown.  The model holds facts about the
world represented by sets and vectors.

      This work is based on theories presented in upper-
division linguistics courses.
